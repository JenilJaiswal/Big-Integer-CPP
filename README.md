## 📝 Overview

This project features a robust Big Integer class in C++, capable of handling and performing arithmetic on integers far exceeding the standard data type limits. This library supports a wide range of operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and more complex functionalities like bitwise operations and modular arithmetic. It also provides solutions for common mathematical problems like factorial, Fibonacci, Catalan numbers, and exponentiation using Big Integers.

### 🛠️ Features

- **🔢 Arbitrary Precision Arithmetic**: Handle integers of virtually unlimited size, constrained only by memory.
- **⚙️ Comprehensive Operations**: Supports a full suite of arithmetic operations, including:
  - **➕ Addition (+)**
  - **➖ Subtraction (-)**
  - **✖️ Multiplication (*)**
  - **➗ Division (/)** 
  - **➗ Modulo (%)**
  - **🔀 Bitwise operations (&, |, ^, ~)**
  - **🔄 Logical operations (&&, ||, !)**

- **📐 Mathematical Functions**:
  - **Factorial calculation**
  - **Fibonacci sequence generation**
  - **Catalan number computation**
  - **Exponentiation (power function)**

- **🔍 Exception Handling**: Includes checks for special cases like division by zero.
