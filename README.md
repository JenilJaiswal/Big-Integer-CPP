# Big Integer Library in C++

## Overview
This project features a robust Big Integer class in C++, capable of handling and performing arithmetic on integers far exceeding the standard data type limits. This library supports a wide range of operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and more complex functionalities like bitwise operations and modular arithmetic. It also provides solutions for common mathematical problems like factorial, Fibonacci, Catalan numbers, and exponentiation using Big Integers.
